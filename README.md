# Napireli-JAVA
Completed technical task for the traineeship candidates of Anderson.
[Completed Task](./Main/src/Main.java)

# Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
- No, it's not correct
- instead of first "(" we need to use "[" and it will be correct

# Bonus
To run Java program we need to compile it:
`javac Main.java`  
or
`javac -jar Main.java` - if we need compile it as jar file.  
and to run it `java Main`
